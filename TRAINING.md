# Groovy Training

This repository contains various Groovy scripts and examples to help you learn and practice Groovy programming. Below is a description of each file:

## Files

### 1_hello_world.groovy
This script demonstrates a simple "Hello, World!" program in Groovy. It shows how to print text to the console, and how to use comments.

### 2_variables.groovy
This script covers variable declaration and initialization in Groovy. It includes examples of different data types and how to use them.

### 3_collections.groovy
This script demonstrates how to work with collections in Groovy, including lists, maps, and ranges. It shows how to create, access, and manipulate collections.

### 4_lists_maps.groovy
This script provides examples of working with lists and maps in Groovy. It includes examples of creating, accessing, and manipulating lists and maps.

### 5_loops.groovy
This script provides examples of different types of loops in Groovy, including `for` loops, iterating over ranges, lists, arrays, and maps.

### 6_logic.groovy
This script covers logical branching and looping in Groovy. It includes examples of `if-else` statements, the ternary operator, and the Elvis operator. It also demonstrates how to create and iterate over a list of users.

### 7_operators.groovy
This script covers various operators in Groovy, including the spread operator, safe navigation operator, and operator overloading. It also includes examples of iterating over lists and handling null values.

### 8_closures.groovy
This script provides more advanced examples of closures, including memoization and measuring execution time. It includes the `callClosure` function to demonstrate these concepts.

### 9_expando.groovy
This script demonstrates the use of the `Expando` class in Groovy, which allows you to add properties and methods to an instance at runtime. It includes examples of creating an `Expando` instance, adding properties, and defining methods.

### 10_metaprogramming.groovy
This script introduces metaprogramming in Groovy, showing how to modify or extend the behavior of classes at runtime. It includes examples of using `ExpandoMetaClass`, method interception with `GroovyInterceptable`, and handling missing properties with `propertyMissing`.

### 11_precompiler.groovy
This script demonstrates the use of the `@TypeChecked` and `@CompileStatic` annotations in Groovy to enable compile-time type checking and static compilation. It includes examples of type-related errors being caught at compile time.

### 12_OT_runtime_variables.groovy
This script shows how to work with JSON in Groovy, including parsing JSON strings, iterating over JSON objects, and pretty-printing JSON output. It uses the `JsonSlurper` and `JsonOutput` classes.

### 13_OT_transformer_variables.groovy
This script demonstrates how to convert Groovy objects to JSON strings and pretty-print them. It includes examples of using `JsonOutput` to serialize objects and format the JSON output.

### 14_OT_payload.groovy
This script shows how to handle dependencies in Groovy, including importing classes and using them in your code. It includes examples of working with external libraries and handling dependencies.

### 15_OT_dependency.groovy
This script processes a JSON payload, enriches user data by fetching additional information, and returns the enriched data as a JSON object. It includes examples of using `JsonSlurper`, `JsonOutput`, and `JsonBuilder` for JSON handling.

### 16_OT_helpers.groovy
This script demonstrates how to handle dependencies and external services in Groovy. It includes examples of setting up message headers, sending requests, and parsing responses.
